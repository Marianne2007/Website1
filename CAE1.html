            and/or being talented isn't going to give you a 
            guaranteed success in life, being determined and 
            motivated is because it you are smart but not motivated 
            then you won't get very far, but even when you're not 
            smart but determined that will take you far enough to

            Introduction: The speaker talked about the problems that 
            we are having like how even the smartest students was 
            having trouble in their classes.

            <br>
            Body: The speaker talked about how she got the 
            conclusion of trying to be more understanding to her 
            students and her realizing things such as students or people 
            in general have trouble in their everyday lives no matter 
            that kind of talent they have or no matter how attractive 
            or how smart they are they would still face difficulties if they 
            don't have the determination that they would need to 
            persevere through all the difficulties and hardships to finish 
            what they have started.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Conclusion: Being something or someone you can't hold 
            on to is useless because even if you are something or 
            someone who is amazing at every that won't give the 
            benefit of the doubt because even you are are something 
            or someone its useless if you don't give it support if you 
            don't try then what's the point?, If your just going to give up 
            then what's the point?, If you don't have the strength to 
            continue the journey that you started, the journey that you 
            set up then you did everything for nothing being amazing, 
            being smart, being attractive is nothing if you aren't trying.</td></tr>

            (What are the best/worst delivery skills/techniques of the speaker?)</th>
	<td>The speaker was very loud and clear which I like, but she 
            wasn't that easy to understand from my point of veiw, I did 
            understand most of it but she used some words that some 
            people don't or might not understand and that can give 
            her a disadvantage because just like trump when he was 
            running for president people understood what he meant 
            because unlike other politicians they would say something 
            like " a profession" but instead he would say "a job" and 
            that is why many people understood him more because 
            his didn't use hard words that some might not understand 
            and that is probably one of the reasons as to why he won 
            the election.</td></tr>

            opinions because that is what they are bias/prejudice are 
            only opinions that some might or might not agree with.</td></tr>
